/**
 * The canonical verification contract, shared by the backend API and the
 * Next.js client.
 *
 * Before this module the codes and messages existed twice: authoritatively in
 * `backend/src/services/payment-verification.ts`, and again as a
 * hand-maintained JavaScript mirror in `frontend/lib/verification.js`
 * whose own header told future editors to "keep the codes and messages here
 * identical to the backend module". Two lists that must be kept identical by
 * hand are two lists that eventually differ, and the failure mode is a pay
 * screen promising one thing while the server rejects for another.
 *
 * There is now one list. `backend/src/services/payment-verification.ts`
 * re-exports it and `frontend/lib/verification.js` re-exports it, and a
 * backend test asserts the backend's public surface still matches this module
 * exactly, so a reintroduced local copy fails the suite instead of shipping.

/**
 * The four payment checks, in the fixed order the verifier must run them.

 * fails several checks at once, the code the user sees depends on which check
 * ran first. Encoding the order here means both sides agree on it rather than
 * each inferring it from its own if-chain.
